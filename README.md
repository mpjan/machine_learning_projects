# machine_learning_projects

This repo is a collection of personal projects as I learn more about data science and machine learning.

## Index

So far, these projects include:

- [Descubra as melhores notas de matem√°tica do ENEM 2016 (Desafio Codenation)](https://github.com/mpjan/machine_learning_projects/blob/master/nota_enem_matematica/notas_enem_matematica_2.ipynb)
- [Predicting credit card applications](https://github.com/mpjan/machine_learning_projects/blob/master/credit_card_applications/credit_card_applications.ipynb)

## GitHub and rendered Jupyter notebooks

If GitHub fails to render a notebook you can go to https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and simply paste the GitHub link to the notebook there.
